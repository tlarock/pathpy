class RollingTimeWindow:
    r"""
    An iterable rolling time window that can be used to perform time slice
    analysis of time-stamped network data.
    """

    def __init__(self, temporal_net, window_size, step_size=1, directed=True, return_window=False):
        r"""
        Initialises a RollingTimeWindow instance that can be used to
        iterate through a sequence of time-slice networks for a given
        TemporalNetwork instance.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        temporal_net:   TemporalNetwork
            TemporalNetwork instance that will be used to generate the
            sequence of time-slice networks.
        window_size:    int
            The width of the rolling time window used to create
            time-slice networks.
        step_size:      int
            The step size in time units by which the starting time of the rolling
            window will be incremented on each iteration. Default is 1.
        directed:       bool
            Whether or not the generated time-slice networks should be directed.
            Default is true.
        return_window: bool
            Whether or not the iterator shall return the current time window
            as a second return value. Default is False.

        Returns
        -------
        RollingTimeWindow
            An iterable sequence of tuples Network, [window_start, window_end]

        Examples
        --------
            >>> t = pathpy.TemporalNetwork.read_file(DATA)
            >>>
            >>> for n in pathpy.RollingTimeWindow(t, window_size=100):

            >>>     print('Time window starting at {0} and ending at {1}'.format(w[0], w[1]))
